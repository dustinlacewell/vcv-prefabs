# Prefabs Changelog

## 2.0.2 - 1/31/2023

Ongoing menu refactors and improvements...

- Unorganized prefabs (those not in a sub-directory) now show in the "untagged" menu.
- Toggling state favorites is less finicky.
- Ctrl must be held when opening the widget to see the full state library. The previous behavior of being able to
  toggle it while the menu was open was janky and uncomfortable to maintain.
- Module library and search results now sorted.
- Select how modules are sorted in state library using settings context-menu.
- Toggle which tags are shown in state library using settings context-menu.
