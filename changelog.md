# Prefabs Changelog

## 2.0.2 - 1/31/2023

Ongoing menu refactors and improvements...

- Unorganized prefabs (those not in a sub-directory) now show in the "untagged" menu.
- Toggling module favorites is less finicky.
- Ctrl must be held when opening the widget to see the full module library. The previous behavior of being able to
  toggle it while the menu was open was janky and uncomfortable to maintain.
- Module library and search results now sorted.
- Select how modules are sorted in module library using settings context-menu.
- Toggle which tags are shown in module library using settings context-menu.
